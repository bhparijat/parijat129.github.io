Hi there! Welcome to page!!

My name is Parijat Bhatt, a Master of Science student at Oregon State University, working in machine learning and AI. Prior to joining Oregon State University, I worked as a full stack engineer at CGI, India. I graudated from Indian Institute of Technology, Dhn in 2017 and my interests involve data analysis, machine learning and deep learning.

I hail from Gorakhpur, a city in northern part of India and when I am not doing work, you may find me at the gym, or playing pool. I love reading and very recently I have been exploring the philosphy of stoicism. I like to blog about data analysis and you may find some of my posts at [medium](https://medium.com/@parijat.bhatt)
